## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### If emails don't arrive:

2. Verify the Service ID and Public Key are correct
3. Make sure the email templates are published
4. Check the browser console for error messages

### If you get CORS errors:
1. Make sure you're using the correct Public Key
2. Verify the service is properly configured
3. Check that the templates are published

## ðŸ“§ Email Format
When working correctly, you'll receive emails like this:

**From**: The person who filled out the form
**To**: ahmedvrgaming@gmail.com
**Subject**: Contact Form: [subject] or Career Application: [position]
**Body**: All form data formatted nicely

## ðŸš€ Alternative: Quick Test Setup

If you want to test immediately without full setup:

1. The forms already have a fallback that opens the user's email client
2. This will work right now for testing
3. Users can manually send the pre-filled email to your address
