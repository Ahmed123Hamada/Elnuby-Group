# Quick Email Setup - Get Emails Working in 5 Minutes

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Status
The forms are set up but need a working email service to send emails directly to `ahmedvrgaming@gmail.com`.

## ðŸš€ Quick Solutions (Choose One)

### Option 1: Formspree (Recommended - 2 minutes)
1. Go to [formspree.io](https://formspree.io)
2. Sign up for free account
3. Create a new form
4. Copy the form endpoint URL
5. Replace the URL in `src/services/emailSender.ts`:
   ```typescript
   const response = await fetch('YOUR_FORMSPREE_URL_HERE', {
   ```

### Option 2: Netlify Forms (If hosting on Netlify)
1. Add `data-netlify="true"` to both forms
2. Deploy to Netlify
3. Forms will work automatically

### Option 3: EmailJS (5 minutes)
1. Go to [emailjs.com](https://emailjs.com)
