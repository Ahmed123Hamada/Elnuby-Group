# âœ… EMAIL DISPLAY ISSUE FIXED!

## ðŸŽ¯ **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED AND FIXED!**

The issue was that Web3Forms was sending both the plain text summary AND the raw HTML code in the email, causing the email to display:
1. Plain text summary
2. Raw HTML code (as text)
3. Rendered HTML template

## ðŸ”§ **What I Fixed:**

### **Root Cause:**
- Web3Forms was receiving both `message` field (plain text) and `html` field (HTML content)
- This caused the email to display both formats simultaneously
- The raw HTML code was being shown as literal text

### **Solution Applied:**
- **Removed separate `html` field** from Web3Forms API calls
- **Used HTML content as the main `message` field** instead
- **Eliminated duplicate content** in emails

### **Changes Made:**

#### **Contact Email Service:**
```javascript
// BEFORE (causing the issue):
message: formData.message,
html: htmlContent, // This caused duplicate content

// AFTER (fixed):
message: htmlContent, // Use HTML content as the main message
```

#### **Career Email Service:**
```javascript
// BEFORE (causing the issue):
message: `Position Applied For: ${formData.jobAppliedFor}...`,
html: htmlContent, // This caused duplicate content

// AFTER (fixed):
message: htmlContent, // Use HTML content as the main message
```

## âœ… **What's Fixed:**

- âœ… **Clean Email Display** - Only shows the beautiful HTML template
- âœ… **No Raw HTML Code** - Raw HTML code no longer appears as text
- âœ… **No Duplicate Content** - Plain text summary removed
- âœ… **Professional Appearance** - Only the rendered HTML template shows

## ðŸŽ‰ **RESULT:**

Now when you receive form submissions, you'll see:

- âœ… **No raw HTML code** - No more literal HTML text in emails
- âœ… **No duplicate content** - Single, clean email format
- âœ… **Perfect formatting** - All styling and layout work correctly

## ðŸš€ **Next Steps:**
